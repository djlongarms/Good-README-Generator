This application will help a developer set up a full README for their application. A user can input the title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, contribution guidelines, and testing guidelines. The user can then choose from a list of licenses for their application to be covered under. They can then input their github username and an email for inquiries about the project.

The application will then create a file with a table of contents and fill out the information for each section.
